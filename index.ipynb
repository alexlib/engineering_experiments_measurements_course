    "\n",
    "Use [Git](http://git-scm.org/) to download the files (or download the [zip file](https://github.com/spatialaudio/communication-acoustics-exercises/archive/master.zip)), use the Python package management system [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install a few Python libraries that we will use and then start the IPython notebook:\n",

    "Alternatively, you can also download individual notebook files (with the extension `.ipynb`) and open them in IPython.\n",
    "Note that some exercises make use of additional files (audio files etc.) which you'll then also have to download manually.\n",

    "We use so far Python 2, we will move to Python 3 soon. \n",

    "If you don't have Python installed already, you should download and install a Python distribution which already includes all the libraries we'll need, e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)"
