# Engineering Example: Uncertainty Analysis in Mechanical Measurements

## Introduction to the Engineering Problem

In mechanical engineering, precise measurements are critical for ensuring proper component functionality and system reliability. Let's explore a practical example of uncertainty analysis in measuring a precision shaft diameter for an engine bearing.

### The Engineering Context

A precision shaft needs to be measured for an engine bearing assembly:
- Required diameter specification: 25.000 ± 0.010 mm
- Measurement using digital micrometer
- Critical for proper bearing fit and engine performance

```{admonition} Why This Matters
:class: warning
Measurement errors can lead to:
- Oversized shaft: Bearing won't fit
- Undersized shaft: Excessive clearance, potential failure
- Consequences: Engine failure, warranty claims, safety issues
```

## The 8-Step Uncertainty Analysis Process

### Step 1: Define Measurement Needs

**Required Measurement:**
- Shaft diameter at specific location
- Tolerance: ±0.010 mm

**Equipment Selection:**
- Digital micrometer (0-25 mm range)
- Resolution: 0.001 mm
- Calibration uncertainty: ±0.002 mm (k=2)

**Measurement Conditions:**
- Temperature-controlled room (20 ± 1°C)
- Clean measurement surfaces
- Multiple measurements needed

### Step 2: Perform Measurements

**Measurement Data:**

| Reading | Value (mm) | Reading | Value (mm) |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | 24.998 | 6 | 25.001 |
| 2 | 25.001 | 7 | 24.999 |
| 3 | 25.000 | 8 | 25.000 |
| 4 | 24.999 | 9 | 25.001 |
| 5 | 25.000 | 10 | 25.000 |

**Recorded Conditions:**
- Temperature: 20.5°C
- Operator: J. Smith
- Date: 27-10-2024
- Equipment ID: MK-103

### Step 3: Evaluate Uncertainties

#### Type A Uncertainty (Statistical Analysis)

1. Calculate mean:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} = 24.9999 \text{ mm}$$

2. Calculate standard deviation:

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}} = 0.001 \text{ mm}$$

3. Calculate standard uncertainty:

$$u_A = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.001}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.00032 \text{ mm}$$

#### Type B Uncertainties (Other Sources)

1. **Calibration Uncertainty:**
   - Given as ±0.002 mm (k=2)
   - Standard uncertainty: $u_{B1} = \frac{0.002}{2} = 0.001 \text{ mm}$

2. **Resolution Uncertainty:**
   - Resolution = 0.001 mm
   - Half-width = 0.0005 mm
   - Standard uncertainty: $u_{B2} = \frac{0.0005}{\sqrt{3}} = 0.00029 \text{ mm}$

3. **Temperature Effect:**
   - Steel expansion coefficient: 11.5 × 10⁻⁶/°C
   - Temperature uncertainty: ±1°C
   - Length effect: $25 \text{ mm} × 11.5 × 10^{-6} × 1°C = 0.00029 \text{ mm}$
   - Standard uncertainty: $u_{B3} = \frac{0.00029}{\sqrt{3}} = 0.00017 \text{ mm}$

### Step 4: Check Independence

**Independent Sources:**
- Random measurement variations (Type A)
- Calibration uncertainty
- Resolution uncertainty

**Potentially Correlated:**
- Temperature effects on shaft and micrometer
- For this example, we'll treat them as independent (simplified case)

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
In more complex cases, correlation between uncertainty sources must be considered in the calculations.
```

### Step 5: Calculate Results

**Base Result:**
- Mean value: 24.9999 mm
- Calibration correction: 0 mm (included in uncertainty)
- Temperature correction: negligible at 20.5°C
- Final value: 24.9999 mm

**Measurement Conditions Verification:**
- Temperature within specifications
- Proper measurement technique used
- Equipment calibrated and certified

### Step 6: Find Combined Uncertainty

For independent sources, the combined standard uncertainty is calculated as:

$$u_c = \sqrt{u_A^2 + u_{B1}^2 + u_{B2}^2 + u_{B3}^2}$$

Substituting our values:

$$u_c = \sqrt{(0.00032)^2 + (0.001)^2 + (0.00029)^2 + (0.00017)^2}$$
$$= \sqrt{0.0000001024 + 0.000001 + 0.0000000841 + 0.0000000289}$$
$$= \sqrt{0.0000012154} = 0.0011 \text{ mm}$$

### Step 7: Calculate Expanded Uncertainty

Using k = 2 for 95% confidence level:

$$U = k \cdot u_c = 2 × 0.0011 = 0.0022 \text{ mm}$$

```{admonition} Interpretation
:class: note
We are 95% confident that the true diameter lies within ±0.0022 mm of our measured value
```

**Comparison to Tolerance:**
- Tolerance: ±0.010 mm
- Uncertainty: ±0.0022 mm
- Measurement system is capable (Uncertainty < 1/4 tolerance)

### Step 8: Document Results

**Final Result:**
$$(24.9999 ± 0.0022)\text{ mm }(k=2, 95\% \text{ confidence level})$$

**Major Sources of Uncertainty:**
1. Calibration uncertainty (largest contributor)
2. Measurement repeatability
3. Resolution limits
4. Temperature effects

## Practice Questions

1. Why is the expanded uncertainty (k=2) used rather than the standard uncertainty?
2. How would you modify this analysis if the temperature variation was ±2°C instead of ±1°C?
3. What would be the impact if the measurement uncertainty was larger than 1/4 of the tolerance?
4. How would you handle correlated uncertainty sources if temperature effects couldn't be treated as independent?
