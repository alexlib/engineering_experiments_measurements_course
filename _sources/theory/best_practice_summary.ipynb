E.g. assume the real, true value is 82.3 then it means that our **measurement error** is 0.3 kg. (82.3 - 82 = 0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we think about uncertainty we shall also wonder whether we did it right, do we stand correct on the weight? is the weight calibrated? maybe we shall do it several times, etc. i.e. we feel that 82 kg that the weight shows only some value (one measurement) but it does not say anything about the next value we will get if we try to measure again, using this weight scale or another, maybe using different method, etc. We want to estimate the weight and we could only know it with **some uncertainty and for some confidence level**. So we could say that we estimate our weight to be $ 82 \\pm 1.5 $ kg at 95\\% confidence level. Where the value 1.5 is coming from? That's our course is about. \n",
