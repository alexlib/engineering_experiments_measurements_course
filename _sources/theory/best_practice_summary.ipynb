    "## Uncertainty of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty is the value we give to the quality of measurement - to the quality of how good the measured value is or how certain we are about that value\n",
    "\n",
    "_uncertainty of measurement is the doubt that exists about the result of any measurement_\n",

    "### Expressing uncertainty of measurement \n",
    "\n",
    "We answer two questions: how big is the margin around the best estimate of measurement value and how certain or how bad is the doubt - therefore we provide two numbers: the width of the margin or _interval_ and the _confidence level_ \n",

    "The length of the rod is measured as 20 cm plus or minus 1 cm at the 95\\% confidence level: \n",

    "## Error is not uncertainty \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common remark on all the exams in our course ;) \n",
    "\n",
    "We CANNOT confuse **error** with **uncertainty** : \n",
    "\n",
    "**error** is the difference between the measured value (a result of act of measurement) and the ``true`` value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**uncertainty** is a quantification (giving a value to the doubt) of the doubt about the measurement result. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example: we measure weight - we see on the weight the value 82 kg. We know that the value is 82 kg but the real, true weight is somewhere near, maybe 81.5 or 82.3. E.g. assume the real, true value is 82.3 then it means that our **measurement error** is 0.3 kg. (82.3 - 82 = 0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we think about uncertainty we shall also wonder whether we did it right, do we stand correct on the weight? is the weight calibrated? maybe we shall do it several times, etc. i.e. we feel that 82 kg that the weight shows only some value (one measurement) but it does not say anything about the next value we will get if we try to measure again, using this weight scale or another, maybe using different method, etc. We want to estimate the weight and we could only know it with **some uncertainty and for some confidence level**. So we could say that we estimate our weight to be $ 82 \\pm 1.5 $ kg at 95\\% confidence level. Where the value 1.5 is coming from? That's our course is about. \n",

We also learn that if we repeat the measurement, the risk of making a large error is reduced and we get closer to the true value (never completely close, only closer). We need here some statistics knowledge to use to get a better estimate. \n",

All these errors, plus other errors, scaled by their proper distributions (different events - different statistics or distributions) - will become that \"measure of doubt\" that we call **uncertainty**\n",
