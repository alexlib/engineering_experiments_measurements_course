# Notes of the "Engineering Measurements and Instrumentation" course

by [Prof. Alex Liberzon](https://turbulencelab.sites.tau.ac.il), School of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University

<!-- This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
 -->
 
This book does not replace the course materials, but rather organizes it in Jupyter and Markdown notebooks. We hope is useful as an assistance learning material for undergraduate engineering laboratory courses. It is an open source project and any contribution is welcome ( contact us on [Github](https://github.com/alexlib) ).
 
This course follows the {cite}`textbook`
