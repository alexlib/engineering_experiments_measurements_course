    "   - many students hired for roles that involve measurements and tests\n",
    "   - modern methods of data collection utilize measurement uncertainty analysis\n",
    "   - our laboratory A is designed to introduce the concepts of measurements, instrumentation, and measurement uncertainty analysis\n",
    "   - we use standard mechanical measurement tools \n",
    "   - students obtain small and large sample sizes, use the idea of ``propagation of uncertainty'' using length and diameter measurements and estimate volume with its uncertainty\n",
    "   - comparing different groups results help to understand the variation involved in measurements and the concept of uncertainty, helping to work effectively in large engineering groups"

    "Many times the measured property can be obtained indirectly. In our example volume of a cylinder is obtained using diameter and length measurements and calculation using the function $V = \\pi D^2 L /4$. In such cases, we need to estimate how much uncertainty of diameter affects the uncertainty of volume measurement (and calculation) or in other words how *uncertainty propagates* from length to volume or from diameter to volume uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory says that if we want to measure $F = F(x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_n)$ then the uncertainty of $F$, called $u_F$ depends on the uncertainties of $x_1$ multiplied by the sensitivity factor $\\partial F/\\partial x_1$. We get: \n",
