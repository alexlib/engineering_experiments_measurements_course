<!-- This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
 -->
 
This book does not replace the course materials, but rather organizes them in Jupyter notebooks, hopefully useful for your learning period and your other laboratory courses
 
This course follows the book {cite}`ruby`
